    <h2 class="white">Introduction</h2>
      <p class="gray">Dear travellers from all over the world,</p>
      <p class="gray">As you know very well by now, unfortunately it is not <br>
        possible to access some of the websites here. Besides <br>
        those inaccessible websites often turn out to be the ones <br>
        we <em>need</em> to access the most for various reasons, for example <br>
        to keep in contact with family and friends.<br>
        <br>
        To access those websites, we need something called <br>
        a Virtual Private Network, usually known as VPN.<br>
        I can help you set up a <em>closed</em> VPN server,<br>
        which means it is not available on App store or on<br>
        Google Playstore, which means it is more reliable and <br>
        safer to use simply because <em>the Big Brother</em> does not<br>
        know its existence ;).<br>
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="setup">
      <h2 class="white">Setting Up</h2>
      <p class="gray">To enjoy this closed VPN server, I need to set it up<br>
        myself, which means we'll have to meet up somewhere in Beijing.<br>
        This can be easily organised if you contact me.<br>
        This can be set up on any devices - iOS, Android, Windows, Macbook (Chromebook, even).
